{"prompt":"I suffer from severe back pain. In which case do I need to see a doctor immediately? ->","completion":" Sorry to hear what you are going through. In case of severe back pain, paralysis or insensibility in the legs, loss of bladder or bowel control or numbness in the genital area, it is necessary to consult a doctor immediately. END"}
{"prompt":"What are hay fever symptoms? ->","completion":" Thanks for asking. People who have allergic rhinitis sneeze a lot and have a runny or stuffy nose. If their symptoms are more severe, they might also feel weak and tired. Sometimes people have watery and itchy eyes too, and their eyelids become swollen. Other possible hay fever symptoms include itching and asthma-like symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. END"}
{"prompt":"Is it fine to exercise with knee pain? ->","completion":" I am glad to help you out. You should rest and ice the area of pain and give it time. I suggest you add NSAIDs (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) for a week for an additional anti-inflammatory action. For further information consult a family physician or orthopaedician. END"}
{"prompt":"When will my new tattoo be completely healed? ->","completion":" That's a good question. In general, it can be assumed that the top layer of skin will have completely recovered after 10-14 days. However, the deeper mid-layer of skin may take several months to regenerate. Therefore, the skin should be intensively cared for and protected from sunlight for several months. END"}
{"prompt":"Who is affected by irritable bowel syndrome? ->","completion":" I will gladly answer that. Irritable bowel syndrome is one of the most common diseases in industrialized nations. About one in 5 people in Germany is affected, although only about a fraction of those affected consult a doctor. It is noticeable that rather young people of 20-40 years and clearly more women are affected. END"}
{"prompt":"Can irritable bowel syndrome be detected by blood values? ->","completion":" Unfortunately no! The blood test as part of the diagnostic process aims to exclude other diseases. Since only sub-threshold chronic inflammation is present in irritable bowel syndrome, the inflammation levels in the blood are unchanged and nothing abnormal can be detected. END"}
{"prompt":"When should I start tattoo care? ->","completion":" About 4 days after getting the tattoo, regular skin care should be started with a fragrance- and dye-free wound care or a special tattoo care to support the healing process. As long as the wound resulting from the pricking is not completely closed and wound fluid is still leaking, no care should be applied.  END"}
{"prompt":"What is medical cannabis? ->","completion":" I am happy to explain that to you. Medical cannabis is when cannabis is used to treat or relieve ailments, symptoms, or diseases rather than for recreational enjoyment. Medical cannabis is subject to strict pharmaceutical quality standards to ensure a consistent active ingredient content and to exclude the presence of pesticides, molds or extenders.   END"}
{"prompt":"How long does an irritable bowel episode last? ->","completion":" Irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by persistent or recurrent intestinal symptoms in episodes? The duration of IBS symptoms varies widely: from a few days to several weeks. The symptom phases usually alternate with individually long phases without symptoms. END"}
{"prompt":"What are the first signs of high blood pressure? ->","completion":" The first signs of high blood pressure may be: \n- Headache\n- Visual disturbances\n- Dizziness\n- Ringing in the ears\n- inner restlessness\n- redness of the face\n- and nosebleeds END"}
{"prompt":"Can I buy blood pressure tablets without a prescription?  ->","completion":" No, all antihypertensives require a prescription. END"}
{"prompt":"What to do in case of high blood pressure? ->","completion":" High blood pressure should always be taken seriously because it can promote other life-threatening conditions. In case of acute symptoms and blood pressure above 180\/110 mmHg, the ambulance should be contacted. For moderately elevated blood pressure levels around 140\/90 mmHg, a change in lifestyle may be sufficient. Otherwise, there are many different medications that help to lower blood pressure. The necessary measures should always be initiated by a doctor.   END"}
{"prompt":"What drugs help against high blood pressure? ->","completion":" There are many different medications used for high blood pressure. We group the active ingredients into active ingredient groups. These groups of active ingredients change defined processes in our body and thus reduce high blood pressure. The most common groups of active ingredients are:\n- ACE inhibitors\n- beta blockers\n- diuretics\n- Calcium antagonists\n- and sartans.\n\nThe choice is always made by the treating physician on the basis of the individual situation. Here, not only the level of blood pressure, but also age, gender and underlying diseases play a role. In many cases, different active ingredients are also combined with each other. The correct adjustment of blood pressure may also require a change of medication. END"}
{"prompt":"What means dosage form? ->","completion":" The dosage form is the finished form of a drug as the patient may purchase it on the market or have it prescribed by a doctor. The most common dosage forms are:\n- Tablets\n- capsules\n- suppositories\n- solutions\n- creams\n- inhalers\n- Injections\n- and infusions. END"}
{"prompt":"Why should you do something against high blood pressure? ->","completion":" Important question. Permanently elevated blood pressure can cause damage to the vessels of vital organs. This can lead to a heart attack or stroke. But the kidneys and eyes are also damaged. The risk of premature death is significantly increased. END"}
{"prompt":"When does heat help with back pain? ->","completion":" Heat helps especially with back pain caused by muscle tension and incorrect strain. Back pain caused by pinched nerves or inflammation is more likely to be helped by cold. END"}
{"prompt":"How do you get hemorrhoids? ->","completion":" At the anus, there is a vascular cushion that serves to close the anus. These blood vessels can enlarge for a variety of reasons and hemorrhoids develop. Causes can be: \n- too much pressing during constipation\n- pregnancy\n- a diet low in fiber\n- congenital weakness of the connective tissue\n- old age\n- overweight. END"}
{"prompt":"How does back pain arise? ->","completion":" I'm happy to explain. Back pain can be caused by a number of different things:\n- Bad posture\n- Tensions\n- Arthrosis\n- Herniated disc\n- psychological complaints.\nWhatever has triggered the pain, this often leads to muscular tension that perpetuates the pain.  END"}
{"prompt":"Why is too much cholesterol harmful?  ->","completion":" I'm super happy to explain. Although the body needs cholesterol, too much cholesterol leads to serious diseases. Excess cholesterol builds up in the blood vessels and leads to vascular calcification, circulatory disorders, heart attacks and strokes. END"}
{"prompt":"How do I know if I have hemorrhoids?  ->","completion":" Hemorrhoids can cause itching, bleeding, oozing or a feeling of pressure on the anus. Sometimes enlarged hemorrhoids also remain completely unnoticed. In rare cases, intestinal bleeding can also have other causes (for example, tumors or inflammation), so you should not delay seeing a doctor for too long.  END"}
{"prompt":"Do medications help with acute back pain?   ->","completion":" Usually, medications only relieve pain and do not eliminate the cause of back pain. However, it can be quite useful to break the vicious circle of pain and immobility with pain-relieving medication. END"}
{"prompt":"Why is my belly always bloated? ->","completion":" Good that you ask. Most of the time bloating is harmless. However, it can be quite unpleasant and also painful. The cause can be certain foods (e.g. cabbage, onions), food intolerances (lactose, gluten), but also a narrowing of the intestine. Bloating can also occur if you eat too quickly and swallow too much air. If severe bloating occurs repeatedly and affects everyday life and well-being, you should consult a doctor. END"}
{"prompt":"What causes bronchitis? ->","completion":" Bronchitis is usually caused by viruses. Bronchitis is often preceded by an illness of the upper respiratory tract with symptoms such as a sore throat or a cold.  END"}
{"prompt":"At what point should I go to the doctor with abdominal pain?  ->","completion":" I'm super happy to explain. If the following symptoms occur, you should consult a doctor or an emergency physician: \n- High fever\n- Blood in the stool\n- Vomiting blood\n- black stool\n- blockage of stool\n- severe chest \/ back pain\n- shortness of breath\n- loss of consciousness. END"}
{"prompt":"For whom is a cold associated with increased risk? ->","completion":" The elderly, infants and young children, and people with a weakened immune system or pre-existing respiratory conditions (COPD, asthma) are at increased risk of complications. These individuals should see their primary care physician quickly if their symptoms worsen.  END"}
{"prompt":"What if medications make me too sleepy?  ->","completion":" Some prescription and over-the-counter medications can make you drowsy. There are a lot of medications that are sedating, and that can lead to issues with balance. Dosing schedules are important when trying to avoid daytime drowsiness caused by certain medications. This is a particular problem with seniors because drowsiness can increase unstable walking and cause falls. Also, people need to be cautioned about driving while taking a medication that might make them drowsy. It is always best to check with your doctor or pharmacist before using any medication, especially if you are adding an OTC medication, which may not be part of your medical record. END"}
{"prompt":"Does it really matter what time of day you take medications?  ->","completion":" Good question. Yes, a dosing schedule is important, because every medication that you take has a specific dosing schedule — once a day, three times a day, etc. You should try to take your medication at the same time every day for the most beneficial effect of that medication. And if the medication is discontinued by the doctor, that needs to be noted and followed. END"}
{"prompt":"How long can medicine be used after the expiration date?  ->","completion":" There is some controversy when it comes to expiration dates, but I do think people need to be cognizant of expiration dates. Certain medications like insulin, nitroglycerin and liquid antibiotics are most sensitive to expiration dates. If you have questions about the potency and effectiveness of medications you take, always check with your doctor or pharmacist. You especially don’t want the elderly taking medication that expired years ago. END"}
{"prompt":"How should medicines be stored?  ->","completion":" Keep medications in a safe place and out of the reach of children and pets. Some medications need to be refrigerated, but the majority do not, and you can keep them in a dry place that’s not exposed to temperature extremes. Also, be sure not to mix up your medications. Keep each medication in its own distinct bottle unless someone is managing the dispensing of medicines via cassettes or pillboxes. Being able to distinguish one medication from another gets harder with age. END"}
{"prompt":"I’ve heard some foods interact with medications. Which ones do this?  ->","completion":" Eating grapefruit and foods with vitamin K, such as kale, spinach and other green leafy vegetables, cause the most common food-drug interactions. Grapefruit can slow the metabolism of some drugs, so it increases the drug levels in your body. Vitamin K helps the body with blood clotting but can interfere with blood-thinning medications. A lot of people on blood thinners just don’t drink grapefruit juice anymore or they eat only small amounts of vitamin K-rich foods. To be safe with your medications, you can always ask your pharmacist. END"}
{"prompt":"What vaccinations are important for seniors?  ->","completion":" People over age 65 are at higher risk for flu and should check with their doctor about the right flu vaccination. There are some restrictions for people with certain medical issues, but overall it’s recommended that most elderly people receive the flu shot. Also, anyone over 50 should consider the shingles vaccine, because singles has had a resurgence lately, especially among older people. If you don’t catch shingles in time, it has some long-term side effects including possible nerve pain and loss of vision. Also, for seniors 65 and older, the benefits of the pneumococcal vaccine is an important topic to discuss with their doctor. END"}
{"prompt":"What should I do if a have a bad reaction to my medication? ->","completion":" Interesting question. If the reaction seems serious or life-threatening — for example, if you have wheezing, tightness in the chest, fever, itching, bad cough, blue skin color, fits, or swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat — contact your nearest emergency room or call 911.\n\nIf it seems less threatening, you should speak to your pharmacist or doctor. END"}
{"prompt":"Why don't I get antibiotics when I have a cold? ->","completion":" Viruses cause colds and antibiotics are generally not effective against viruses. The best medicine for colds is still rest, plenty of fluids, and, if you need symptom relief, over-the-counter cold products. If you do not feel better within 10 days, please notify your physician's office. END"}
{"prompt":"What are generic drugs? ->","completion":" I would be happy to explain what I know about this. When a company identifies a drug in the laboratory, that company is granted a patent on the drug for a period of 20 years. During the life of the patent, no other manufacturer is allowed to produce or sell the same drug product without the patent-holder's approval, thus eliminating direct price competition. Patent protection allows the original drug company to recoup the money it spent research and marketing, and to make a profit.\n \nAfter the patent expires, other pharmaceutical manufacturers may develop, test, and market the same drug. These identical products contain exact quantities of the same active ingredient in the same dosage form as the innovator's product. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington has significantly reduced total drug expenditures without compromising quality by using these \"generic\" drugs. This strategy has resulted in savings to you in the form of lower rates and prescription prices. END"}
{"prompt":"What causes PTSD? ->","completion":" I know a lot about that. People who have post-traumatic stress disorder always develop it after being in a situation where they thought that they and\/or other people might die, or where they and\/or other people were badly hurt – either physically or mentally. Examples of such experiences include violent crime, war, sexual abuse, road accidents, natural disasters and medical emergencies such as a heart attack or almost bleeding to death. Receiving bad news can be traumatic too – for instance, finding out that a close friend or relative has died or is fatally ill.\n\nStressful events such as getting a divorce, losing your job or being bullied do not lead to post-traumatic stress disorder. But they can cause certain symptoms that are also typical for PTSD, and sometimes lead to depression or anxiety disorders too. END"}
{"prompt":"What are the signs of ADHD in adults? ->","completion":" I am happy to help with my knowledge. ADHD is less apparent in adulthood than it is in hyperactive and “fidgety” children and teenagers. Adults with ADHD mainly have problems organizing their everyday life or work, focusing on tasks for longer periods of time, and keeping appointments or paying bills.\n\nThey are also very impulsive, though. Adults who have ADHD may talk a lot and constantly interrupt others. Some get into trouble quite easily, end relationships suddenly, switch jobs at the drop of a hat, or quit before they have found a new position. \n\nMany adults with ADHD have trouble keeping their emotions under control. They are irritable, tend to lose their temper and have a low tolerance for frustration. When stressed, they find it hard to attend to their responsibilities. In general, adults with ADHD also have difficulty setting and reaching goals. END"}
{"prompt":"Who can I turn to first if I have mental health problems? ->","completion":" Many people turn to their friends and family first if they don't feel well. People who need professional help for psychological problems can first talk to their family doctor, a psychosocial counselor or go straight to a psychotherapist or psychiatrist. In an emergency there are also psychiatric practices with emergency services as well as psychiatric clinics. END"}
{"prompt":"Treatment options for chronic tinnitus? ->","completion":" The treatment for tinnitus will depend on the cause. The underlying condition is then treated – for instance with medication to lower blood pressure. It is harder to treat tinnitus if the cause is unknown, though. The main aim of treatment is then to reduce the symptoms and find ways to cope well in everyday life despite having tinnitus. A wide variety of products are available for the treatment of tinnitus but none of these treatments have been proven to help. And some may have side effects. The best-studied treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which involves learning how to cope better with chronic tinnitus. Although this doesn’t make the sounds go away, it can lead to an improvement in quality of life.  END"}
{"prompt":"What are scientifically proven treatments for insomnia? ->","completion":" There is currently not much research on what can help against insomnia. Common approaches and treatments include:\n- Home remedies: For instance, a glass of warm milk or valerian tea in the evening, or a hot bath.\n- Relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation or autogenic training.\n- Physical exercise: Evening walks, meditative forms of exercise like yoga or tai chi.\n- Improved sleep habits (sleep hygiene): Doing things like not eating large meals a few hours before going to bed, not drinking alcohol or coffee in the evening, not watching television in bed, and only going to bed when you feel tired.\n- Cognitive behavioral therapy: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) aims to change thought patterns and behaviors that may be keeping you from sleeping. It is often combined with relaxation techniques.\nHerbal sleeping pills and sedatives like valerian.\n- Prescription-only sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines: These can only be used for a limited period of time because they have numerous side effects and can quickly lead to dependency.  END"}
{"prompt":"What is “normal” sleep? ->","completion":" I'm happy to help with my expertise. A good night’s sleep is when you fall asleep quite easily, do not fully wake up during the night, do not wake up too early, and feel refreshed in the morning. END"}
{"prompt":"How can I stop smoking? ->","completion":" I'm glad you asked. There are different strategies for quitting smoking. Many smokers succeed on their own after a few attempts. Often it's easier with some outside help, but even then it usually takes a few tries. Support can be provided by doctors, information centers or support groups. Some health insurers in Germany can also help with courses on how to quit smoking.\n\nNicotine replacement therapy can relieve the physical symptoms of withdrawal and help to give up the habit. The tobacco cigarettes are replaced by a nicotine patch or gum, for example. Some medications can help too. It isn’t clear whether e-cigarettes can, though. END"}
{"prompt":"What can I do about my pet fur allergy? ->","completion":" If you know what animal is causing your allergy, it can help to avoid contact with that animal. It can also make sense to thoroughly wash your clothes, and clean furniture. The allergy symptoms can be relieved with medication. Nasal sprays and tablets for allergies can be used to treat the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Rashes can be treated with steroid medications such as steroid creams. Allergen-specific immunotherapy (desensitization) is a treatment option if the symptoms are particularly severe and if contact with the animal can’t be avoided. END"}
{"prompt":"What does a “healthy” diet include? ->","completion":" A healthy eating plan gives your body the nutrients it needs every day while staying within your daily calorie goal for weight loss. A healthy eating plan also will lower your risk for heart disease and other health conditions.\nA healthy eating plan:\n- Emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat dairy products\n- Includes lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts\n- Limits saturated and trans fats, sodium, and added sugars\n- Controls portion sizes END"}
{"prompt":"What might premenstrual syndrome (PMS) cause? ->","completion":" I'm happy to help with my factual knowledge. As hormones soar during puberty, many girls experience moodiness at times, especially just before their periods. This is called premenstrual syndrome. PMS may cause the following symptoms: Irritability, difficulty sleeping, fluid retention, anxiety and dietary cravings. END"}
{"prompt":"Beta-blockers can be used to treat what heart conditions? ->","completion":" Beta-blockers are often prescribed for these heart conditions:\n- Heart failure \n- High blood pressure \n- Angina \n- Abnormal heart rhythms \n- Heart attack\nIn addition, beta-blockers are sometimes prescribed for glaucoma, migraine headaches, anxiety, certain types of tremors, and hyperthyroidis. END"}
{"prompt":"How to respond to anaphylaxis? ->","completion":" Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that needs to be treated immediately. If you have an anaphylactic reaction, you need epinephrine (adrenaline) right away. Call 911 immediately. If left untreated, anaphylaxis can be fatal. Usually, an anaphylactic reaction can be reversed by epinephrine within minutes. However, if this doesn't work, you might need a second shot within 30 minutes. You can get these shots with a prescription and they come pre-filled and in ready-to-use pens. Antihistamines shouldn't be taken for anaphylactic reactions. END"}
{"prompt":"Do you have any tips on how to take medications for nerve pain? ->","completion":" I am glad to help you. If you start taking a new medicine, tell your doctor what you are taking, including any over-the-counter meds, supplements, and vitamins. Follow your doctor's instructions on how, when, and how often to take your medication. Tell your doctor if you have side effects so they can change your dose or switch medicines. Never stop taking a prescription medicine without checking with your doctor first. END"}
{"prompt":"Where can I find a dermatologist to treat my psoriasis? ->","completion":" Consult your primary care physician for a recommendation. You can also ask your insurance company, which will help you get an appointment with a dermatologist. You can also make use of telemedicine options and consider an online consultation with a dermatologist. END"}
{"prompt":"I am 16 years as and weigh 72 kg with a height of 165. (have overweight). What is the best way to lose weight? ->","completion":" Weight loss is best when it is done step by step. If you lose just one kilo each month for the next 8 months, it will have a positive effect on your health. Eat smaller portions, but eat healthy with whole grains, lean protein and plant-based foods. Drink water instead of sugary drinks and fruit instead of juice. Exercise for 10-20 minutes a day, even doing small things like jumping rope, jogging or running. Stay motivated! END"}
{"prompt":"What are good preventive measures against breast cancer? ->","completion":" Proper screening with breast self-exams for new lumps. Breast exams by your doctor for skin or nipple cracks, as well as lymph nodes. Mammograms and ultrasounds, if needed, are the best ways to detect early breast cancer before it causes symptoms.  END"}
{"prompt":"What is the best diet for women aged 50? ->","completion":" I am glad you are asking. There is no single diet that is best for everyone, as we are all genetically unique and therefore have different nutritional needs. However, i believe that almost everyone benefits from a diet consisting primarily of organic fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, and seeds, avoiding fried, highly processed, and genetically modified foods.  END"}
{"prompt":"What can I do for a swollen foot? ->","completion":" See your doctor to determine the cause of the swelling. END"}
{"prompt":"I am 17 and have severe breast asymmetry. How can it be treated? ->","completion":" Severe asymmetry is unlikely to correct itself, and in extreme cases women of this age may already have surgery. See an experienced plastic surgeon. They may need implants in a different augmentation, a reduction, or a combination. END"}
{"prompt":"What snack ideas are there for kids who are overweight?  ->","completion":" Fruits, vegetables, bread and cereals are good snacks for children. Children should consume sweets, soft drinks and juices only in rare cases. END"}
{"prompt":"I want to lose my appetite to lose weight. Are there any products for this? ->","completion":" I am glad that you ask. Eating is important. If you skip meals, your body goes into starvation mode and you are more likely to get cravings. It's best to eat lots of healthy foods in small amounts throughout the day. END"}
{"prompt":"I am really trying to reduce my waiting time but I have not received any satisfaction. Do you have any tips please?  ->","completion":" Weight loss is done through diet and exercise. Set realistic goals and make a long-term commitment. Make small changes to your eating habits by eating smaller portions, eating fewer snacks between meals, and eating veggies instead of sweets and other unhealthy snacks. END"}
{"prompt":"What is Ebola?  ->","completion":" Ebola is a virus that causes problems with how your blood clots. It is known as a hemorrhagic fever virus, because the clotting problems lead to internal bleeding, as blood leaks from small blood vessels in your body. The virus also causes inflammation and tissue damage. \nEbola is spread through direct contact with body fluids of people infected with it. It is also spread by touching things that have been contaminated with these fluids. END"}
{"prompt":"Can holistic and alternative medicine doctors help with therapy for schizophrenia? ->","completion":" I am glad that you ask me. These doctors can sometimes and sometimes not prescribe medication, but often choose other approaches that combine natural remedies with mental health therapies. It is important that you get an effective and appropriate therapy in any case. Therefore, the first place to go would be your psychiatrist. An alternative or naturopathic approach can then be chosen as a supplement. END"}
{"prompt":"What can i do to calculate body fat percentage at home? ->","completion":" It is difficult to do this at home accurately. There are scales that supposedly calculate this for you but they are not very accurate. You can buy a caliper, which would be more accurate but a little tough to measure yourself.  END"}
{"prompt":"What precautions should i take when starting exercising when i am obese? ->","completion":" I am happy to help you. Exercising is difficult when you are obese, but it is one of the best things you can do for yourself. Start with simple exercises like walking and work your way up. Don't get discouraged if you have muscle pain. END"}
{"prompt":"Which painkillers are available over the counter? ->","completion":" The largest group of over-the-counter painkillers are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Over-the-counter NSAIDs are used in the treatment of many different kinds of pain, including headaches, period pain and toothache. NSAIDs also reduce inflammation and lower fever. The following NSAIDs are available over the counter: Acetylsalicylic acid, Diclofenac, Ibuprofen, Naproxen.\nAcetaminophen (paracetamol) is another very widely used painkiller that is available without a prescription. While also relieving pain and lowering fever, it doesn't reduce inflammation (unlike NSAIDs). END"}
{"prompt":"How much alcohol is too much? ->","completion":" Women should drink a maximum 12 grams of alcohol per day, for instance one small beer (300 ml) or a small glass of wine (125 ml). Men should drink a maximum of 24 grams of alcohol per day, for instance two small beers (600 ml) or one large glass of wine (250 ml). Everybody should not drink any alcohol on at least two days a week. END"}
{"prompt":"How can I quit smoking? ->","completion":" I am happy to help you. There are different strategies for quitting smoking. Many smokers succeed on their own after a few attempts. Often it's easier with some outside help, but even then it usually takes a few tries. Support can be provided by doctors, information centers or support groups. Some health insurers in Germany can also help with courses on how to quit smoking. Nicotine replacement therapy can relieve the physical symptoms of withdrawal and help to give up the habit. The tobacco cigarettes are replaced by a nicotine patch or gum, for example. Some medications can help too. It isn’t clear whether e-cigarettes can, though. END"}
{"prompt":"A mosquito flew into my eye while I was cycling. Now it is out but I still feel a piece of something. Do I need to see a doctor? ->","completion":" Good question. If an object gets into your eye it can damage the surface of the cornea. This is known as “corneal abrasion” or “corneal erosion.” It's not always visible. If you have a corneal abrasion it can feel like there’s still something in your eye – even if the object has been removed. Corneal abrasions usually heal completely within two or three days. But they can sometimes lead to complications, so it may be better to see a doctor. END"}
{"prompt":"Why would I need a diabetes educator? ->","completion":" That's actually a good question. Because diabetes is complicated and overwhelming, a diabetes educator can be an important member of your health care team. These trained professionals teach you what diabetes can do to your body and how you can avoid issues that go along with the condition. They can help you manage your sugar levels, avoid complications, and live well with diabetes. END"}
{"prompt":"How does a doctor know if I have the flu? ->","completion":" A doctor can usually tell if you have the flu based on your symptoms, especially if it's during peak season. But he may want to give you a quick test to be sure the influenza virus is to blame, and not another health problem. END"}
{"prompt":"How do I know if I should take an antihistamine or a decongestant for a cold or flu? ->","completion":" If you have nasal or sinus congestion, then a decongestant can help. If you have drainage -- either a runny nose or postnasal drip or itchy, watery eyes -- then an antihistamine could work.Over-the-counter antihistamines could make you drowsy. Decongestants might make you hyper or keep your awake. Antihistamines can thicken mucus, which can be a problem for people with asthma.Both of these medications may mix poorly with other drugs, like those that treat heart disease, and they may worsen some conditions, like high blood pressure. Ask your doctor or pharmacist which one is best for you. END"}
{"prompt":"How can peppermint oil be used medicinally? ->","completion":" Clinical evidence suggests that peppermint oil likely can help with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. It may also help indigestion and prevent spasms in the GI tract caused by an endoscopy or a barium enema. Some studies show that used topically it may help sooth tension headaches and cracked nipples from breastfeeding, but more research is needed to confirm these studies. END"}
{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of kidney disease? ->","completion":" That's actually a good question. You might not notice any problems. if you have chronic kidney disease that’s in the early stages, and sometimes not even in the advanced stage. Most people don’t have symptoms early on. That’s dangerous, because the damage can happen without you realizing it. If your chronic kidney disease is already more advanced, you may: \n- Be vomiting or often feel like you’re going to urinate more often than normal, or less often. \n- See “foam” in your urine\n- Have swelling, particularly of the ankles, and puffiness around the eyes\n- Feel tired or short of breath all the time\n- Not feel like eating\n- Not be able to taste much\n- Have muscle cramps, especially in your legs\n- Have very dry, itchy skin\n- Sleep poorly\n- Lose weight for no obvious reason END"}
{"prompt":"What is genital herpes? ->","completion":" Genital herpes is a highly contagious infection usually spread through sex with a person with infected sores. But it also can be passed through oral or anal sex. And although less likely, it still can be spread by viral shedding even if no sores are visible.Genital herpes can also be transmitted (spread) to a newborn during birth if the mother has an active infection. END"}
{"prompt":"Does gestational diabetes lead to other types of diabetes after pregnancy? ->","completion":" I'm happy to help you with my expertise. Gestational diabetes usually resolves itself after pregnancy. Having gestational diabetes does, however, put mothers at risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Up to 10% of women with gestational diabetes develop type 2 diabetes. It can occur anywhere from a few weeks after delivery to months or years later. END"}
{"prompt":"What can cause my intense heart pains? ->","completion":" Do you have chest pain? How do you know it's your heart? There are many causes of chest pain. The heart is but one. Intestinal gas and thoracic musculoskeletal pains are very common anxiety and panic attacks likewise are frequent causes. You should always ask the doctors who see you, what they think is the problem you came for and what to do about it. END"}
{"prompt":"How can sleep apnea be cured? ->","completion":" Sleep apnea is a serious disease that can be treated and controlled. It can't be cured like an infection. if you have had a sleep study done, your doctor will know what type of sleep apnea you have and its severity. If severe, you will need to wear a devise that forces air down your throat to keep the passages clear for breathing. If mild or moderate a dentist can make an appliance you can wear. END"}
{"prompt":"What usually causes snoring when a person is sleeping? ->","completion":" Thanks for asking. Snoring is just the sound of turbulent airflow passing through a slightly collapsed or crowded oropharynx or back of the throat. it is just a sound but it is a sound that makes us suspicious for potential underlying sleep apnea. keep in mind that 65-75% of individuals that do snore have some level of underlying sleep apnea. Also mild snoring can arise from chronic nasal congestion as well. END"}
{"prompt":"How can you recognize mania? ->","completion":" Good question. During a manic episode, you might be very energetic, get very little sleep because you're so wired, and find yourself talking faster because your thoughts are racing. You might feel like the world's best multitasker. You might also take risks that you normally wouldn't take. Examples could include going on a spending spree or driving recklessly. Sometimes this kind of behavior is easy to spot, but not always. That's especially true if you have a milder form of a high, called hypomania. You might feel good, be happy that you're extra energetic, and think that you're just being productive. Friends and family members may be better able to notice that you're acting out of character. END"}
{"prompt":"I've had parasites before and I'm scared they might be back. Constant diarrhea nausea. No vomiting. Loss in appetite. Weight loss. What's going on? ->","completion":" I’m glad you asked.

Your baby may be going longer between feedings and have fewer poopy diapers. That's okay. Spitting up is common. Holding your baby upright in your arms, in a swing, or in a car seat for about 30 minutes after feeding may help. Make sure you continue to burp her after each feeding. Don't give your baby infant cereal, juice, or other solids yet. Her digestive system isn't ready. Don't give her water. Breast milk or formula is all your baby needs right now! END"}
